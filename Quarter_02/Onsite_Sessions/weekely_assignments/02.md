#   Assignment 02: Understanding Key API and Software Concepts

- **API**: An API (Application Programming Interface) enables software applications to communicate and share data or functionality, such as using the Google Maps API to embed maps and location services in web or mobile applications.

- **SDK**: An SDK (Software Development Kit) provides tools, libraries, and documentation to help developers create applications, like the Android SDK, which includes emulators and debugging tools for building Android apps.

- **Web APIs**: Web APIs are internet-accessible interfaces that enable interaction with web services, such as the Twitter API, which allows developers to retrieve, post, or manage tweets programmatically over HTTP/HTTPS.

- **Library APIs**: Library APIs offer pre-built functions and tools within a programming library, simplifying tasks like numerical computing with NumPy in Python or DOM manipulation with jQuery in JavaScript.

- **Prompting and Completion**: In AI models, prompting involves giving clear input instructions, and completion refers to the AI's output, as seen in ChatGPT creating articles, code snippets, or creative stories from user-provided prompts.

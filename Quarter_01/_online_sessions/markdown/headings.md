# The Headings
To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).

# This is H1

## This is H2

### This is H3

#### This is H4

##### This is H5

###### This is H6
